My achievements are Auto Robot, Non/Pipelined CPU design & verification , and FPGA Embedded System:   

•	Autonomous Robot, the system was built to learn the environment and decided on the shortest path to follow, implemented on tm4c123 microcontroller programmed in C to control the movement in real time via PID control system and DFS algorithm.

o	Non-Pipelined CPU, the processor was an integer 32-bit architecture with a Barrel Arithmetic Shifter unit performing arithmetic calculation.

o	Pipelined CPU, functional units of MIPS processor built as 5-stage pipeline with hazard detection and forwarding unit to speed up the performance by more than 4x.
